Changes Left 

- Stop button to throw exception to at least stop the multiple scans & Running the sweep operation on a separate thread/process
- Need to handle keyboard interrupt. Unlikely to make it restart from where it stopped...
- ERROR CHECKING REGEX SAMPLE NAME - CANNOT HAVE COLON AND OTHER SYMBOLS
- Check sample name with previous sample name, and warn users that they are the same. Either just continue after warning, or show a dialog box and offer the user the chance to abort the start().
